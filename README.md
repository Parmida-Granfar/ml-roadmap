A roadmap to mastering machine learning , balancing theory and practice . 

Welcome to this Machine Learning Guide, a structured learning path and resource hub for anyone starting out in machine learning. This repository is the result of everything I’ve learned and experienced throughout my years studying ML. If I could go back and start from scratch, this is the exact roadmap I would follow.

When I first began learning machine learning, I was overwhelmed by the number of algorithms, libraries, and mathematical concepts to grasp. I often found myself asking: Where should I start? Do I need to master math first? Which algorithms are most important? After years of trial and error, countless tutorials, courses, and projects, I’ve identified a balanced approach to studying ML that prioritizes both practical implementation and theory.

This guide is designed to help you avoid the same confusion and overwhelm. It focuses on:

Essential algorithms that you should understand deeply.

Key libraries you’ll use for implementing models quickly.

A balanced approach to learning: You don’t need to master advanced math upfront, but you also shouldn’t rely entirely on libraries. The goal is to know how things work behind the scenes while still building projects early on.


Whether you come from a coding background or a more theoretical one, this guide will help you gain a solid foundation in machine learning—by both doing and understanding. Dive in, build models, and learn the concepts that truly matter for real-world applications.

This is the roadmap I wish I had when I started. I hope it provides clarity and helps you accelerate your learning journey.
